This repo is to track my solidity language study and
I would like to tell you about Solidity.

# Introduction to Solidity
a high-level, statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is widely used for creating decentralized applications (DApps) and automating blockchain-based processes. Inspired by languages like JavaScript, C++, and Python, Solidity provides features such as inheritance, libraries, and user-defined types to write secure and efficient contracts.

Key Features:
	•	Built specifically for Ethereum and compatible blockchains.
	•	Supports complex smart contract interactions and state management.
	•	Enables decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, DAOs, and more.

Getting Started:
To begin with Solidity, you’ll need:
	•	A code editor like Remix IDE or a local setup with tools like Hardhat or Truffle.
	•	A basic understanding of Ethereum and smart contract workflows.
